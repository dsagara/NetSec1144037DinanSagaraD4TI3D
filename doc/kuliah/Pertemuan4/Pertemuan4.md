A packet sniffer is a utility that has been used since the original release of Ethernet. Packet sniffing allows individuals to capture data as it is transmitted over a network and is used by network professionals to diagnose network issues, and by malicious users to capture unencrypted data, like passwords and usernames. If this information is captured in transit, a user can gain access to a system or network.

If you want to keep information confidential or are concerned about packet sniffing, work on encrypted protocols and encrypt all sensitive data being sent over the Internet or network (e.g. e-mails). For example, e-mails can be encrypted using PGP, anyone still using Telnet should consider using SSH instead, and instead of FTP you can use SFTP.

In common industry usage, a sniffer (with lower case "s") is a program that monitors and analyzes network traffic, detecting bottlenecks and problems. Using this information, a network manager can keep traffic flowing efficiently.

A sniffer can also be used legitimately or illegitimately to capture data being transmitted on a network. A network router reads every packet of data passed to it, determining whether it is intended for a destination within the router's own network or whether it should be passed further along the Internet. A router with a sniffer, however, may be able to read the data in the packet as well as the source and destination addresses. Sniffers are often used on academic networks to prevent traffic bottlenecks caused by file-sharing applications.

The term "sniffer" is occasionally used for a program that analyzes data other than network traffic. For example, a database could be analyzed for certain kinds of duplication.
